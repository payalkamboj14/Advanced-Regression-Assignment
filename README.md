# Advanced-Regression-Assignment
Repository containing submissions files for Advanced Regression Assignment for Housing Company Problem

## Objective
This case study is focussed on a US based housing company that wants to enter the Australian Market. The company has collected past housing sales data in Australia and wants to use data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

#### Goal
Goal is to help the housing company by building a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company should be able to use the model to know -
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Additionally, we will also determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
